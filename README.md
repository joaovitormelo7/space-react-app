# Space Photo Gallery
This project is a _Space Photo Gallery_ built as part of the TypeScript course from Alura to deepen my understanding of React. The gallery showcases stunning photos of space, offering features like filtering by tags, expanding images, and marking images as favorites.

## Features
- _Tag Filtering_: Easily find photos based on specific tags to view categories of interest.
- _Image Expansion_: Click on an image to view it in a larger, more detailed format.
- _Favorites_: Mark your favorite images for quick access later.

## Technologies Used
- _React_: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- _TypeScript_: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- _Styled-Components_: A library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application.

## Usage
Once the project is running, you can explore the gallery by filtering photos using tags, clicking on photos to expand them, and favoriting the ones you like.

## Future Improvements
- _Search Functionality_: Add a search bar to quickly find photos by title or description.
- _User Accounts_: Implement user authentication to allow saving favorites across sessions.
- _Pagination_: Implement pagination for better navigation through large collections of photos.
